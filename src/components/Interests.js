            <p className="subtitle">Travelling</p>
            <p>I spent 5 months travelling through South East Asia and Australia just before the start of lockdown last year. I loved the Philippines which really took me by surprise, and I’d love to go to South America next or even Spain - I’m looking to brush up on my Spanish!</p>

            <p className="subtitle">Reading</p>
            <p>I love all kinds of fiction, for me it’s such a great form of escapism! The best way to switch off for me is with a really gripping crime novel (I love Agatha Christie!).</p>

            <p className="subtitle">Cooking</p>
            <p>I love cooking - I find it so therapeutic. I also love doing cookery courses to try and improve my skills and try different methods of cooking. I've done courses at Leith’s Cookery school in London and and River Cottage in Axminster, and would highly recommend both!</p>

            <p className="subtitle">Health and Wellness</p>
            <p>This ties into my love for cooking; I’m so interested in the mechanics of food and nutrition, and how big an impact it can have on our overall health and well being. It’s also fascinating how food is able to affect us on both a physical and a psychological level.</p>
